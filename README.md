# odin-recipes

This project is an entryway into the world of HTML. The main purpose of this project is to showcase basic HTML principles and a coherent understanding of HTML fundamental through the use of a recipe based website. 
Several different recipes are featured in this project in order to practice linking different pages to the source index.html. The use of image links, ordered lists, and unordered lists are also practiced within each recipe page. 

Aside from the HTML components of this project, connecting this repository to Github as well as making commmits were a huge focus on this project. As this is my first project, I will hopefully be able to write better README files as well as commit messages.
